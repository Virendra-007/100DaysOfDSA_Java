# 🚀 Day 13 – Spring Boot Basics Wrapped & Deep Dive Started

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Finished a complete Spring Boot beginner tutorial
  - Project structure: `Controller`, `Service`, `Repository`

  - Understanding how Spring handles requests under the hood

## 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Spring Boot reduces boilerplate by using **auto configuration**
- REST APIs can be built rapidly with proper layer separation
- DI & IoC are powerful principles that make code modular and testable
- Gained confidence to begin building real-world backend apps

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Spring Initializr
- Postman (for testing APIs)

## 📌 Next Focus:
- Build a simple CRUD API (Employee or Product Management)
- Connect Spring Boot to MySQL
- Learn about JPA (`@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Id`)
