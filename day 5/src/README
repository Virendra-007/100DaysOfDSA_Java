##  Problem Statement:
You are given integers X, Y, Z, and two arrays A and B of length N.  
You must perform **N operations**, each choosing one of:
1. Subtract B[i] from sum
2. Decrease X and Y by 1, then add A[i] × X × Y × Z to sum
3. Decrease Y and Z by 1, then add A[i] × X × Y × Z to sum

### Conditions:
- After every operation, X, Y, Z ≥ 0
- Find the **maximum sum possible**
- Return answer modulo 10⁹ + 7

##  Code Written:
- Solved using Java basics like:
  - Arrays
  - Loops
  - If conditions
  - Simple logic without advanced DSA

##  Learnings:
- Practiced logic building for real constraints
- Strengthened array handling and arithmetic logic
- Learned how to simulate multiple operations with state tracking
