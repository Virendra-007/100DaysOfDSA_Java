# ðŸš€ Day 3 - Sorting & Searching in Java
âœ… What I Learned

 Merge Sort
- A Divide and Conquer algorithm
- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`
- Works by dividing the array and merging sorted parts

 Quick Sort
- Another Divide and Conquer algorithm
- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)` average, `O(n^2)` worst-case
- Selects a pivot and partitions the array around it

 Linear Search
- Simple search algorithm
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Checks each element sequentially
