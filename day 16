Day 16: Spring Boot Annotations & Beans
**What I learned:**
- The role and importance of Spring Boot annotations.
- Deep dive into `@SpringBootApplication` â€” combining `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
- Created and used **custom beans** using `@Component`, `@Bean`, and `@Autowired`.
- Understood the **dependency injection** concept in Spring Boot.
- Successfully ran a Spring Boot application and accessed it via **web browser**.

**Practiced:**
- Registered beans in multiple ways.
- Used `@RestController` and `@GetMapping` to serve data on the browser.
- Verified bean lifecycle and autowiring through basic outputs.

**Outcome:**
- Got comfortable with the building blocks of Spring Boot.
- Confident in building small REST-based applications using beans and annotations.
